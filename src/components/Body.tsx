            <p>I&apos;m a 22-year-old who recently graduated from California State University, Fullerton with a B.S. in Computer Science. I&apos;m interested 
                in data analysis and full-stack development, mostly front-end. </p>
            <br />
            <p>In my free time I like to workout and watch soccer. I also like listening to 
                music and traveling. I&apos;ve been to 9 different countries, it&apos;s not much, but I hope to make it more.</p>
